Based on PyCDDB by Roland Schäuble. That was last worked on in 2007.

Hey, I needed a CDDB implementation that worked with Python3 so I reworked PyCDDB.
This version is much more pythonic in it's implementation.
It's pretty much a piece of cake to use. Take a look at TestCddb.py.
I versioned it as 1.0.0 since I don't think it will require much tinkering
in the future.

Current external requirements:
	python3
	discid

Installation:
./setup.py build
./setup.py install

Any future improvements will be made here:
